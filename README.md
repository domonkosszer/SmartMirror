# SmartMirror

Our project aims to develop an innovative Smart Mirror, enhanced with touchscreen interactivity through infrared light technology. By integrating both emitters and receivers of infrared light, the touchscreen detects user interactions by identifying interruptions in the light beams, enabling accurate coordinate detection. The primary goal is to create an interactive mirror featuring a display that responds seamlessly to touch inputs. This will allow users to interact with the display and switch between various applications.

To streamline the design and avoid tangled cables, we decided to solder all the connections. However, the soldering process proved more challenging than anticipated, preventing us from achieving the desired results. Additionally, we encountered issues with a loose connection to the screen, which led to flickering and occasional display anomalies, including distorted lighting effects.
